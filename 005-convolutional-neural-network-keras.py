### CNNs use image inputs, good at detecting objects, classifying images, and other computer vision tasks ###
# conventional neural networks take (n x 1) vector as input, but...
# input to a convolutional neural network mostly an (n x m x 1) for grayscale images 
# or (n x m x 3) for colored images, where the number 3 represents the red, green, and blue components of each pixel in the image
